 #  A JavaScript weather app fetches real-time weather data using APIs (like OpenWeatherMap), displays the current weather, temperature, and forecast, and allows user input for location or uses geolocation for automatic detection. It updates dynamically and is often mobile-friendly with error handling for invalid input or failed API calls.
